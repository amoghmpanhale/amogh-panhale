        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p> I'm an AI engineer with a passion for solving hard problems. I specialize in applications of software in healthcare fields. I believe that technology evolves fast, and that we should work hard to use it effectively to help all people everywhere. This website is meant to serve as a sort of portfolio of my projects, current research interests, and just fun stuff I do.<br>
            <br>
            I did my undergrad at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, where I gained valuable experience from amazing researchers and made some friends along the way! <br>
            <br>
            I've also worked at a wound care startup as a Machine Learning Engineer and as a programmer in the UofA's Visual Attention and Social Processes (VASP) lab, where I gained many skills ranging from collaborative problem solving to building deployable software solutions on the fly.
