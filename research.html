        <p>Not all information is bite-sized and available with a 10 minute YouTube video. I read a bunch of papers and need citation chains to build up my knowledge for the cool stuff I want to design. This leads me to include this section of the academic papers I've read along with my summaries and reviews of them. I'm no tenured professor though, so I can totally get stuff wrong. Iteration and collaboration is the name of the game! <br>
            <br>
            Below should be a sort of index of the general topics of the papers I've read, pressing the arrow will go into the specifics of each paper. Feel free to contact me about what you think and let me know if got something wrong! Or just if you liked the summary :)</p>
